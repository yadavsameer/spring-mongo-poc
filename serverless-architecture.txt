Recommended Serverless Architecture on Azure
1. Core Services (Azure Components)
Azure Functions (for backend logic)
Azure Cosmos DB (for NoSQL database)
Azure API Management (for managing APIs)
Azure Static Web Apps (for hosting Angular frontend)
Azure Event Grid (for event-driven communication)
Azure Key Vault (for secrets management)
Architecture Overview
Frontend (Angular 19)

Deployed via Azure Static Web Apps.
Leverage native federation for micro frontends.
Use Azure CDN for faster content delivery.
Backend (Spring Boot)

Implement core logic in Azure Functions.
Use Durable Functions for complex orchestrations.
Use API Management to expose APIs securely.
Database (Azure Cosmos DB)

Use MongoDB API for flexible schema and querying.
Ensure auto-scaling to handle dynamic workloads.
Use Partitioning to optimize performance and cost.
Event-driven Communication

Use Event Grid for seamless integration between microservices and real-time notifications.
Implement Azure Service Bus for reliable message delivery.
Security

Use Azure Key Vault to manage secrets (e.g., API keys, connection strings).
Integrate Azure AD B2C for secure user authentication.
Cost and Sustainability
Pay-as-you-go pricing in Azure Functions makes the architecture cost-effective.
Azure Monitor for observability and diagnostics.
Use Azure Advisor to optimize costs and ensure sustainability.
Benefits
Scalable: Auto-scaling of functions and Cosmos DB.
Reliable: Built-in redundancy in Azure services.
Cost-Effective: Pay-per-use model for serverless services.
Secure: Managed through Azure security best practices.
